== Making your own theme ==

To make your own theme, create a folder in the themes/ folder and copy the png (only this format is supported) files in it. Rename them accordingly (remove the spaces and use lowercase letters only, example: facebook is facebook.png, Last Fm is lastfm.png etc.).

Then create a file theme.txt in the same folder and put the following text in it (change the name, author, webpage and description accordingly).

`Name: Simple Icons (default)
Author: Dan Leech
Webpage: http://demos.danleech.com/simpleicons/
Description: The default theme of Social Stickers.`

The file must have all the text listed above and in the exact same order. You must create the file otherwise the theme won't be recognized.
